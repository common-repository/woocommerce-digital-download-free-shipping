Provides Free shipping to Digital Downloads, set by Product Shipping Class.

== Description ==

Provides Free shipping to Digital Downloads.  Why not use the built-in Free Shipping?  Because that is applied to all products in your catalog.  This plugin allows you to set Free Shipping by Product Shipping Class, so that other products in your catalog can have shipping costs as well.
This free shipping is only active if the items in the cart are ALL in this shipping class. Otherwise, your normal shipping methods apply. 
You can see this in the screenshots - as soon as the product that is not in the Digital Free Shipping class (My Boxed Item) is added, the option for free shipping disappears.

== Installation ==

1. Ensure WooCommerce is installed and active.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You will find 'Digital Free Shipping' as a shipping option in your Woocommerce Settings.
This can be found under WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping (tab) > Digital Free Shipping
